# Feedback Coach

## What is Feedback Coach

A tool that helps interviewers improve their feedback and your company make better hires.

Studies have shown that we more easily associate women with [communal adjectives](#communal-adjectives) like caring and team-player and men with [adjentic adjectives](#agentic-adjectives) like assertive and confident.

Although these are all positive attributes, the unfortunate reality is that when individuals are perceived as communal, they are automatically seen as less agentic. Individuals described with agentic adjectives tend to be seen as better leaders. Thus, as we unconsciously accredit men with agentic traits and women with communal ones, we perpetuate our cultural beliefs that men&mdash;who are agentic&mdash;are the natural leaders.

While submitting feedback, use Feedback Coach to learn whether your feedback leans communal or agentic. Consider whether the adjectives were used because they came more easily or because they best describe the candidates contributions.

### Agentic Adjectives

Agentic adjectives denote self-directed actions aimed at personal development or personally chosen goals. Other associations include dominance, qualities relevant for goal-attainment, such as assertiveness, competence or persistence, goal-achievement and task functioning. Generally, words like leader, assertive, confident, intellectual, ambitious, dominant, forceful, independent and outspoken are known as "agentic" (active/assertive) words and have typically described men in the past [(1)](http://www.hispanicoutlook.com/sylvia-mendoza/2015/8/6/can-word-choices-compromise-a-womans-career).

### Communal Adjectives

Communal adjectives describe of, belonging to, or shared by the people of a community; public. Other associations include nurturance and qualities relevant for the establishment and maintenance of social relationships and social functioning (benevolence, trustworthiness).
